The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The sun sets in the west and rises in the east.
The cat in the hat wore a red and white striped hat.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
The sky is a beautiful shade of blue today.
Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.
The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain.
A watched pot never boils, or so they say.
